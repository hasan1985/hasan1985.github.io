Main different between throttling and debounce is that debounce needs to be stop firing event (cooling period) and stay cool for a given time before the given function is executed.
If the event never stops firing the function will never execute.
Throttling will execute the given function after the wait time even if the event is still being fired.

// because of it "this" will not point to global object (Window) inside a function execution by default
'use strict';
const obj1 = {
    name: "obj1",
    func() {
        console.log(Date.now(), this.name);
    }
}

const obj2 = {
    name: "obj2",
    func() {
        console.log(Date.now(), this.name);
    }
}

obj1.func2 = function() {
    console.log("in func2");
    this.func(); // works fine since "this" aka "context" is found "before dot" 
};

let func = obj1.func2;
// func(); // error this is undefined.
// func.call(obj1); // works fine
// func.call(obj2); // works fine

let func_bouned_with_obj1 = obj1.func2.bind(obj1);
func_bouned_with_obj1(); // works fine

// what happens if you call call/apply a bound function with different context from what it was bind with
func_bouned_with_obj1.call(obj2); // the final context will what was bound to the function not the one that is called with.
