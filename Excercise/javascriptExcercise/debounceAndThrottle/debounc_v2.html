Main different between throttling and debounce is that debounce needs to be stop firing event (cooling period) and stay cool for a given time before the given function is executed.
If the event never stops firing the function will never execute.
Throttling will execute the given function after the wait time even if the event is still being fired.

// because of it "this" will not point to global object (Window) inside a function execution by default
'use strict';
const obj1 = {
    name: "obj1",
    func(param) {
        console.log(Date.now(), this.name, param);
    }
}

function debounce(callback, delay) {
    let timeout;
    return function(...args) {
        const context = this;
        timeout && clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(function() { // if use arrow function (or function(){}.bind(this)) then "context = this" is not needed
            callback.apply(context, args) // the callback function might have binding to some context, in that case current conxent will have no effect
        }, delay);
    }   
}

obj1.debounceOfFunc = debounce(obj1.func, 100);
let debounceOnBounedFunc = debounce(obj1.func.bind(obj1), 100); // works as actual function has binding
let debounceWithBind = debounce(obj1.func, 100).bind(obj1); // also works
let debounceWithArrow = debounce(() => obj1.func(), 100) // same as debounceOnBounedFunc

let count = 0;
let interval = setInterval(() => {
    if (count == 4) clearInterval(interval);
    // debounceOnBounedFunc(count); // works
    // debounceWithBind(count); // works
    // obj1.debounceOfFunc(); // works as "context/this" is found from "before dot" 
    // debounceWithArrow(); // works
    count++;
}, 104)


// debounce can have some variations
// 1. should the callback be called asap and rest should be dropped untill there is a pause for the given delay/timeout
// 2. should the subsequent call return the so far result.
// 3. maxWait. The callback will be executed after maxWait time even if the event flow is not paused for the given delay yet.
// lodash has option of both asap(leading) execution of call back and delayed(traling) execution of callback
// it can have flush and cancel

// todo - implement all these features. ex - https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/2da024c3b4f9947a48517639de7560457cd4ec6c/debounce.js
