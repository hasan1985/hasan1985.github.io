Stories for Leadership Principle-

1. Customer Obsession
story-1:
Was debugging a license issue, couldn't find the root cause but found customer updated the version, so I could close the the ticket but I was till looking for the root cause 
Todo - Find out the issue more

story-2:

================================================
2. Ownership
story-1: I was the only UI engineer of EUM Synthetic product for 2 years. I was at frontline to triage any customer escalation tickets
to determine the high issue or redirect to backend engineers.

There was an issue with customer license page for one of our product - "eum-synthetic". We ususally get customer saas page access with user-role of supportEnginner to investigate any issue. But in this case we need admin access becaue only admin can see license page. So I requested customer support team to setup a virtual meeting with customer so that I can investige the issue in their screen. After investigating I found analytics-license check was returning false. "Analytics" used to be sold as a separate product until recently. And to have eum-synthetic data, customer needs analytics data as well. Recently analytics became free along with any other products. So the back-end disabled the analytics license check logic and was returning null to the UI where we didn't un-tie the analytics license check with synthetic license check on this license UI. So even though there sysnthetic product was working fine but the license page was showing "no license". The point I want to express that I immidiatly stablished a contact with customer with my intiative pretty soon for this case.

story-2:
When I moved to another team I seemlessly handed over all knowladge and responsibilty to a new hire engineer for eum-synthetic ui for which for which I used to be the defacto owener for the UI code of this product.

Graph VS tree discussion for ExJM - 
Backend api return directed graph. UX wants tree like view.
Then I proposed a tacky solution

Complete path ExJM - 
Explain existing ExJM issue in details wiki, build a POC solution for PM and UX people to play with.
I went extra steps to convince the PM and UX folks that my design is much better than the existing solution.
And MY solution is based on idea which is completely different from how they are thinking. I wrote two sample
