1.	regular object keys are always string.
	If you use a number or anyother data type
	it will convert to string to be used as a key.
	x = {}
	y = {}
	t = {}
	t[x] = "x"
	t[y] = "y"
	console.log(t[x]) // will not throw any error, will simply print y. think why?

	Where Map can have Object-ref as key.
	map = new Map()
	map.set(x, "x")
	map.set(y, "x") // here x,y are the objects created before
	console.log(map.get(x)) // prints "x"
	console.log(map.get(y))	// prints "y"

	WeekMap removes an entry if it's key is an object and that object is no longer referenced, hence the object is garbage collected;
	where regular Map doesn't do that hence the garbage collector doesn't release (doesn't do gb-collection) the object memory.
