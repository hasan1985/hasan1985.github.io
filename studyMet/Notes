Notes

1. 	In javascript calling a function with 'new' operator acts like a constructor.
2. 	A function, as an object, will always have a field called prototype. This can
	be used as inheritance. This is why it is said JS creates inheritance using
	prototype chain. Prototype is just another object which contains a function
	named "constructor". This actually points to the function (to which the prototype
	belongs to). This constructor function is actaully called when using "new". We
	can see if the constructor function points to any other function (f) then the 'new'
	keyword will invoke that function (f).
